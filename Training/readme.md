# Training

This folder contains the main "learning" project, i.e. the one that generates and refines meta actions.
The bash scripts that are laying in this folder are intented to be used with Labyr.

If you want to run the training, you can use the following command:
```bash
dotnet run
```
You should then get a help screen, where all the available commands for the learning can be seen.
