# Dependencies

The Focused Meta Action project requires a few dependencies.
There is a `setup.sh` script that you can run to install all the dependencies to this folder.
Dependencies must be installed in this folder for all the defaults arguments in the different training and testing scripts to work!

Simply type 
```bash
setup.sh
```
In a linux terminal to install everything needed.
Do note, this will also install a lot of testing and graph generation relevant stuff (such as Labyr and R).
